bodyText: Grommok was a frequent patron of Trollskull Manor and knew Inga fairly well.
  He saw doom hanging around Celebrendil Eldrind and feared that this would be brought
  onto Inga as well. He has tried to contact Celebrendil's phantom before, thinking
  it may have been Inga, but gave up when he learned otherwise.

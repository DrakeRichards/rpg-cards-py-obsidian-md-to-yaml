# Broxley Fairkettle

_(gender:: Male) (race:: Halfling) (class:: Innkeeper)_

![[1708902732.png|+character]]

## Description

### Overview

Broxley is a laid-back, law-abiding member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers. He provides reliable information about the city and its inns to those in need, often under the blessing of a good brew or two.

### Looks

Broxley has the stout frame common to halflings, though he stands slightly taller than most. He has a fair complexion, mutton chops that are nearly as robust as his personality, and bushy eyebrows.

### Voice

His voice is soothing and gentle, reflecting his laid-back nature, and he speaks in a lilting accent that hints at his rural roots.

## Personality

### Quirk

He has a habit of constantly cleaning or polishing something, be it a glass, the bar top, or his own boots.

### Likes

Good company, fine brews, and sharing stories

### Dislikes

Thieves, pranks, and rowdy behavior in his establishment

## Hooks

### Goals

To turn his establishment into the finest inn in Waterdeep and to one day create his own signature brew

### Frustration

A small but pesky group of bards keeps stirring up trouble at his inn during their raucous evening performances and he doesnâ€™t know how to handle their fae-like charm without resorting to force.

### Visits

Inns and taverns are few and far between in the North Ward, so he makes frequent visits to the characters' place to see how it's doing and to offer his well-wishes. If none of the characters are members of the guild, he strongly urges them to join "to avoid further harassment." The cost of membership in the Fellowship of Innkeepers is included in the regular expenses outlined in the "Tavern Keeping Expenses" sidebar.

## Relationships

- Broxley has long believed the tavern to be haunted and is glad to see living souls in it once more. While lamenting the burdens of being a father of nine, he is quick to point out that the characters' continued compliance with guild rules and regulations makes his rather difficult life "just a bitty bit easier."

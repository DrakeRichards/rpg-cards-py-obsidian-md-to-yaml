![[1696133819.png|+side-med-border1-bthin-TLround-TRround-BLround-BRround]]

## Description

The Spiceleaf Library is a grand two-story building with marble pillars and a large stained glass window depicting a world map. The shelves are filled with dusty tomes and ancient scrolls, while cozy reading nooks are scattered throughout the space.

The library specializes in foreign works that Madame Spiceleaf has collected throughout her travels. It also has collections of Waterdavian flatsheets and history books.

## Occupants

The library is owned by [[Madame Irvinent Spiceleaf]], a renowned spice merchant who has travelled far and wide in search of exotic goods. She employs a team of knowledgeable librarians and scribes to maintain and catalogue the vast collection.

[[Sertaar Rustbeard]] is the head librarian. He is strict and exact, and does not tolerate laziness from his employees.

## Story Hook

Rumors have recently spread that a long-lost tome containing a powerful enchantment spell is hidden somewhere within the library. Adventurers are swarming to the Spiceleaf Library, leading to tensions, rivalries, and a secret race to find the hidden treasure within its shelves.

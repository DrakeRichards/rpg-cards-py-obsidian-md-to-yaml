## Description

### Overview

Grommok was a frequent patron of [[Trollskull Manor]] and knew [[Inga Stormcrest III|Inga]] fairly well. He saw doom hanging around [[Celebrendil Eldrind]] and feared that this would be brought onto Inga as well. He has tried to contact Celebrendil's phantom before, thinking it may have been Inga, but gave up when he learned otherwise.

### Looks

Grommok is a large and sturdy half-orc with grayish-green skin. He has broad shoulders and stands taller than most humans. His face bears the scars of battles fought, but his eyes exude kindness and wisdom. Grommok's hair is a dark black, styled in a practical manner. He wears a set of ornate, well-worn clerical vestments adorned with symbols of his deity.

### Voice

Grommok has a deep, gravelly voice that commands attention. He speaks with a rhythmic cadence and a distinct authoritative tone.

## Personality

### Quirk

Grommok has a habit of pausing briefly before making important decisions or speaking profound statements. This pause allows him to gather his thoughts and weigh his words carefully.

### Likes

Grommok enjoys studying ancient texts, delving into the mysteries of divine magic, and helping those in need.

### Dislikes

He dislikes deceit, cruelty, and corruption. He has a particular disdain for undead creatures and seeks to cleanse them from the world.

## Hooks

### Goals

Grommok is dedicated to his faith and strives to protect the innocent and vanquish evil in all its forms. His personal goal is to bring peace and order to the North Ward by performing exorcisms and purging it of undead.

### Frustration

One of his regular patients, a young street urchin named Lila, has fallen dangerously ill with a mysterious disease.

Despite Grommok's best efforts, he has been unable to identify the cause of Lila's illness or find a cure. This has left him feeling frustrated and helpless, as he genuinely cares for the well-being of those in his community.

To make matters worse, the local townsfolk have started doubting Grommok's abilities as a healer, questioning whether he is truly capable of helping them in times of need. This has caused a rift between Grommok and the community he has worked so hard to serve.

Grommok is torn between his desire to heal Lila and prove his worth as a competent cleric, and the fear of potentially failing and losing the trust of the people he cares about. He now seeks guidance and assistance to solve this personal crisis and restore his reputation as a reliable healer in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
